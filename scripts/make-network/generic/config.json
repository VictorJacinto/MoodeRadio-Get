You could edit the radiopack here before copying it to the packs/network directory or you could go ahead and use 'sudo python make-install.py' from ./generic to copy it as is. Make sure you edit config.json file, rename the pack from being named 'generic' and add your stations to the .m3u playlist file. From there run 'sudo python install.py' to create the playlists and folders in Moode. But make sure you change the name of the pack to from generic!
